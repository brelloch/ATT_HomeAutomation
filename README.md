volveR is a project for AT&T Home Automation Hackathon in Atlanta. We won Best Home Automation App. http://about.att.com/newsroom/att_home_automation_hackathon.html

volveR allows the automation of popular home devices such as Nest thermostats and WeMos from a single web page or app. In conjunction, a mobile device with geo-fences can be used to track when individuals enter or exit a region close to their home, turning on or off selected features of these devices.

The basic idea was to do a software version of revolv. However about a week after we finished this project IFTTT announced the same functionality we created for this project so I have moved on and just use that now.

The goal of this project was to experiment with a complete javascript stack. We used the mean.io project from linnovate as a starting point for the site and used appcelerator titanium for the app.
